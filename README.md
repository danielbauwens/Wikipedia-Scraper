## Description
This is my web scraping project, where the goal is to improve my skills with things like requests, BeautifulSoup and Regex.

## Installation & Requirements
You can use this on Python 3.11, and use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to get all necessary packages.

## Usage
To run the code, simply open your command prompt(cmd), powershell or vscode terminal window and type "python leaders_scraper.py" or use the path to both the python.exe and the main.py file. That would look something like this:

'c:/Users/Daniel/Documents/GitHub/Wikipedia-Scraper/.wikipedia_scraper_env/Scripts/python.exe c:/Users/Daniel/Documents/GitHub/Wikipedia-Scraper/leaders_scraper.py'

## Timeline
